NOTE: This is just the sample code to interact with twitter apis. There is chance for lot of improvment. Ex. In-house nodejs based rest apis can be developed to do all the calls individually and these apis can be exposed to frontend. Thus, verification for following, retweeting etc.. all can be done using nice UI.

## Steps to run.

1. Clone the repo
2. run ```npm install```
3. Create a ```.env``` file and add ```BEARER_TOKEN``` (provided by twitter api)
4. run ```node twitter_apis.js```
5. find sample responsed for these api calls inside ```responsed.js``` file.
